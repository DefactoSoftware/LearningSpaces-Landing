          - q: How do I join a Team?

          - q: Where can I log in?
            a: You can log in [here](/login). You will need your team’s domain which looks something like `teamdomain.learningspaces.io`.
               Your login details can also be found in the registration email we’ve sent you.
               Please note that you need to confirm your account before you can log in (sent to you by email).

            a: As a team owner you can change you team’s settings and preferences by clicking the *Settings* in the sidebar, and then click *Team* in the menu.

      - title: Security &amp; Privacy
        questions:
          - q: What about privacy & security?
            a: Your data are safe with us. We will never share your data with anyone. LearningSpaces uses the latest security protocols. Sometimes we even let hackers try to break into LearningSpaces to see whether we are vulnerable to data leaks. You have full control over who can access your community by using the invite-only option or by whitelisting only certain email addresses. We also monitor for conspicuous activity to intercept attempts at stealing data.
          - q: Who owns the data?
            a: You and your team always remain the owner of all data entered in your LearningSpace. And if you decide to stop using LearningSpaces (although why would you?), your data will be deleted after one year.
          - q: How do I include or exclude users from my team?
            a: As a team owner you can define which users can join your team by allowing email domains. For example when you whitelist `mycompany.com` everyone with an email address ending with that domain can sign up or log in. LearningSpaces also has an invite option, so it’s up to you who choose to invite. And of course you are able to deactivate users, or remove them all together.

      - title: Pricing &amp; Billing
