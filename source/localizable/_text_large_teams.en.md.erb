# Large Teams and Organizations

We have a lot of experience working with large organizations. As a matter of fact, we develop software for a lot of them. Talking to key users, HR and management actually made us realize the time is right for 21st century corporate learning. Why would a corporate academy need to be expensive and elaborate?

With LearningSpaces setting up a corporate academy is not only easy and affordable, its social and rewarding features stimulate self-learning of employees like no traditional solution can. And with the emphasis on interaction and informal learning built right into LearningSpaces, organizational culture and behavior are enhanced. This helps maintain intrinsic motivation of employees and prevents gaps in knowledge and experience when valued employees leave the organisation. In fact, LearningSpaces was designed with the  mentoring of new hires by experienced employees in mind.

But we didnâ€™t forget about security either. Although LearningSpaces stimulates openness in learning, we understand the need for protection of valuable corporate knowledge and data. To help protect this information, LearningSpaces supports invite-only accounts or whitelisting of email addresses, to control who has access to all data. And by adhering to the latest security protocols, LearningSpaces keeps these valuable data safe.

With LearningSpaces, the future of corporate learning is easy, safe and social.
