We love small teams! **LearningSpaces** is made by a small team, and very much inspired by the way we learn from each other. LearningSpaces helps you leverage (convert?) the experience of those few most valued colleagues to knowledge for everyone, to inspire your interns and new hires to become pro’s as well.

We want LearningSpaces to transform learning and sharing knowledge, the way Slack transformed communication for teams. To help your team learn and share knowledge, LearningSpaces is free for every team under 10 people. And when your team grows, LearningSpaces grows with you, so we always have the right option for your team.

Share everything, from Google Drive and Dropbox documents to Youtube and Vimeo video’s to pictures from any source. Documents, videos, music or pictures are previewed right in LearningSpaces and you can even edit Google Docs in LearningSpaces to make sharing and engaging as easy as possible.

LearningSpaces is here to help you grow!
