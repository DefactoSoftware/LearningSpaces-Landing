# Trainers and Educators

LearningSpaces is a solution that fits right into every educator’s needs. LearningSpaces' flexibility helps educators and students create content. Whether it's instructions, quizzes or assignments. Tailoring learning material to different needs hardly takes additional effort.

Setting up material for courses with LearningSpaces greatly reduces costs for education, because the learning material in LearningSpaces doesn’t need to adhere to out-dated standards for e-learning. However, with support for the new flexible standard [xAPI](http://adlnet.gov/adl-research/performance-tracking-analysis/experience-api){:target="_blank"} (or [Tin Can API](https://tincanapi.com){:target="_blank"}) in LearningSpaces, you can seamlessly integrate results from courses into HR or business intelligence software.

With the ability to reward and comment on contributions from others, interaction with students was never more direct. This interaction helps grow a learning community, which stimulates exchange of information and discussion online, leaving everyone crucial time for enhanced and effective learning in the classroom.
